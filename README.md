# Dummy-phone
Created a single program(Mini project) to implement mobile phone basic operations like stopwatch, phone lock, call(just process), message(just process), saving and retrieving contacts, searching them, notepads,etc. 

Mini Project in C++ to study File Handling, Computer graphics.
Took multiple refferences for graphics logic but implemented it into this project.
I learnt file handling, C++ object oriented concepts and this project increased my problem solving abilities.
